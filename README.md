We are looking at the representation in the aspect of gender and ethnicity of all the UC schools at the higher education level. The main question is whether this diversity represents California. To investigate this question, we split our project into three parts. In the first part, we present a map and the demographic data of the counties in which the UC schools are located. (Rachel) In the second part, I gave the gender and race differences in all UC schools and picked out schools that performed better and worse on represented gender in each race. (Chen Liu) The last part is about the differences in gender for the grand total given within ten years in STEM and the ten-year fellowship. (Maribel) I considered our teammates to have similar workloads. In the cooperation and integration part, Maribel could pull the data for us, Rachel did the introduction writeup for our project, and I organized all the parts and knitted it into the Html page.
